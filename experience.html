			<h3>I am a Product Designer and Marketing Intern for Michigan Unmasked. Unmasked is an app that was created at Dartmouth to help end the stigma against mental illness for college students across the country. Each university has its own app where their students can anonymously chat with their peers to speak about anything that they might be going through. Unmasked encourages users to be themselves and to be open with their fellow students on the app. I am on the product design and marketing team. I conducted Beta Testing and reported bugs within the app before launch. I also helped launch the app and spread the word about Unmasked to UM students.  </h3>

			<h3>I was a UX Consultant working with a team of four other students to improve MDining's (Michigan Dining) internal employee website. We did this by using Google Analytics to track which pages were being used the most and we focused on those. We conducted user research by interviewing MDining employees to understand the ways the site can and should be improved. I was in charge of the UX of the site. I utilized cutting edge design principles to improve the MDining site and I honed skills in UX, UI and digital strategy.  </h3>

I have conducted user research and interviewed customers to note what they like and do not like about the gallery website.

			<h3>I decided that in order to challenge my UX and graphic design skills, I should challenge myself to create one new design per day. I signed up fro the "Daily UI Challenge". Each day, I am emailed a prompt to design. I have been using Figma to complete these tasks. I have created a sign in page, a calculator, a message board and even a social profile page. I have undoubtedly improved my design skills and gained a deeper understanding of how to use Figma. This challenge has brought out my creative side and it encourages me to push myself to learn more.  </h3>
