        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p> Hi! My name is Jamie Zuckerman and I am a junior at the Univeristy of Michigan studying User Experience Design in the School of Information. I am also studying Marketing and Sales in the Ross School of Business. I am looking to be creative and technical in my future career and develop platforms with the user in mind. I am interested in roles such as User Experience Design, Product Design and Product Management.  </p>
        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p> I am extremely passionate about mental health. I believe that although technology and social media has caused an uprise in mental health disorders, we have the power to create apps and platforms to help people and to improve the mental health of millions of people across the world. In addition, I am also passionate about travelling, cooking and music!</p>
        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p> I have learned so many useful skills through both my courses in the School of Information and my experiences working with clients through the Reach Consulting Group on campus. I have become proficient in Python, HTML and CSS which has helped me see the world through a technical lense. I have also learned to use Figma and Adobe and I have completed projects that have taught me the importance of the design process and keeping the user in mind at all times. Through working with real clients, such as MDining and the Dickerson Art Gallery, I have gained person skills as well, such as leadership, communication and confidence. I am eager to combine all of these skills in my career and create meaninful platforms for users to enjoy. </p>
